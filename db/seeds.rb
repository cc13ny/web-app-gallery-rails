# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# nrows = STDIN.gets.chomp
# puts "creating questions..."
# puts Time.now
# (1..nrows.to_i).each do |nrow|
#   Question.create(:title => 'What is the Maximum Capacity', :text => "Let's try", :user_id => 1)
# end
# puts Time.now
